Project Iodine is the temporary name for a voxel game I am working on.  It is planned to be a multiplayer focused game with a focus on both technology and combat.  
The plan is that most things will be physical and able to be interacted with, and to simulate things like hunger and sleep deprivation a bit more realistically than most voxel games.  
Obviously it is influenced by every piece of information I interact with, but large influences come from Minecraft (although more of a base than how things actually work), Vintage Story, and also games like Allumeria and Fronimus.
